Hello world!

My name is Tobias Maramba. I'm an aspiring programmer and software engineer with a passion for technology, computer science, mathematics, and physics. 

I know bits and peices of a number of programming languages such as Java, C#, C++, Python, and JavaScript. The language I know best, however, is Java, which I have been learning since High School.

I'm on GitHub to showcase my work thus far and to make a difference in open-source software development through collaboration and innovation.
